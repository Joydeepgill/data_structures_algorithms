    Hashing?: 
    - Tranforming a given key/string of characters into a given value 
      -> Result is something thats a shorter, fixed-length value  
         ex: 
            # Key (transform they key) -> (hash step*?) -> hash they key % capacity -> index 

            Index?? 
            - Index is where the K,V pair is stored in the array 

    - Hashmaps store key-value pairs 

    ==================================

    Collisions? 
    - Happens if 2 hashes are found to be the same value  
    - Reslution? 
      - if there is already a value at said index, then create a LL and add another item to
       that index 
   
   Reduce Collisions? 
   - Increase size of hashtable
